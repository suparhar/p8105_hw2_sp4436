## Problem 1 Summary
The `pols` dataset contains information about the number of national politicians by party from 1947 to 2015, with variables including the counts of governors, senators, and representatives, as well as an indicator of whether the president was a Democrat or Republican. The dataset has `r nrow(pols)` rows and `r ncol(pols)` columns, covering the years `r min(pols$year)` through `r max(pols$year)`.

The `snp` dataset contains monthly closing values of the S&P stock index from 1950 to 2015. It has `r nrow(snp)` rows and `r ncol(snp)` columns, covering the years `r min(snp$year)` through `r max(snp$year)`.

The `unemployment` dataset includes monthly unemployment rates from 1948 to 2015, with `r nrow(unemployment)` rows and `r ncol(unemployment)` columns, covering the years `r min(unemployment$year)` through `r max(unemployment$year)`.

After merging, the combined dataset contains `r nrow(merged_data)` rows and `r ncol(merged_data)` columns. Each row corresponds to a unique year–month, and the variables include political party, the president’s party, S&P closing values, and unemployment rates. The merged dataset spans the years `r min(merged_data$year)` through `r max(merged_data$year)`.
